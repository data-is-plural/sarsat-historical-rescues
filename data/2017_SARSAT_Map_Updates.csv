The EPIRB was automatically activated when a small boat sank and its 6-person crew egressed into a life raft. Coast Guard District 07 (CGD07) received the SARSAT alert and passed the information to Operation Bahamas and Turks and Caicos (OPBAT). OPBAT alerted the TCI Police, which deployed a small boat to the search area, but did not find anything. A forward-deployed helicopter from Air Station Clearwater was re-positioning to Providenciales, TCI when it flew over debris and oil sheen in the approximate area of the SARSAT alert. CGD07 directed the aircrew to conduct a visual search of the area. While searching the area, the aircrew spotted 6 people in a life raft. The aircrew lowered a rescue swimmer to the raft, who remained with the individuals in distress. The helicopter then continued on its re-positioning mission to disembark the people who were already on board the helicopter. The aircrew took on fuel in Providenciales and returned to the scene, where they hoisted the 6 people and rescue swimmer from the life raft. The rescue swimmer destroyed the life raft prior to departure and the six survivors were transferred to the TCI Police in Providenciales.
