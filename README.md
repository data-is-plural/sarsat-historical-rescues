# SARSAT Historical Rescue Data

This repository's [`data/`](data/) directory contains seven CSV files representing historical data of rescues enabled by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's [Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking](https://www.sarsat.noaa.gov/) (SARSAT) program. Each file covers one year of rescues, from 2016 through 2022.

The files were provided by NOAA to Data Is Plural via email, in response to an informal inquiry. Given that these files were provided directly by the government, they are released here into the public domain, with no copyright restrictions.
